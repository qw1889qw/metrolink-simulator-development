# Metrolink Simulator

simulating riding the Orange County Line of the ever-so-reliable Metrolink. offers functionality with nested callbacks, Promises & async/await

**notes:**
- data taken from [this page from Metrolink's site](https://metrolinktrains.com/schedules/?type=line&lineName=Orange+County+Line)
- times based on train #607 inbound to Union Station on weekdays
- very little shade @ Metrolink intended; just a little fun project
