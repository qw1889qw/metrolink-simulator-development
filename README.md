**notes:**
- data taken from [this page on Metrolink's site](https://metrolinktrains.com/schedules/?type=line&lineName=Orange+County+Line)
- times based on train #607 inbound to Union Station on weekdays
- 1 second of simulation = 2 minutes of real-time travel
- very little shade @ Metrolink intended; just a fun little project
